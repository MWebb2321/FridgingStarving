# FridgingStarving

## Description

Our task was to build a real-world full-stack app. In this app, we allow the user to input the food they have on-hand in their cupboards, refrigerator or pantry and a recipe will be produced of what meal(s) they are able to make. Our app also allows for date tracking, so they don't potentially use spoiled food, and also what cookware they may need.
